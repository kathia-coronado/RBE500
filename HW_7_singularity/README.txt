The students are asked to analyze the MECADEMIC (Links to an external site.) 500 (R3) robot in terms of their singularity.

First, please series of videos in YouTube to understand the robot.

https://www.youtube.com/user/Mecademic (Links to an external site.)

then watch this video to review singularities

Wrist Singularity at 0:20

Elbow Singularity at 0:28

Shoulder singularity at 0:38 and 0:52

What are robot singularities? (Links to an external site.)
What are robot singularities?

Also read the article  the articl (Links to an external site.)e on their singularity.

Specific Questions...

1) Construct the DH table for the robot in Matlab

2) Construct theJ in the matlab.

3) Decouple the J as needed to discuss the following singularities.

4) Discuss, prove, visualize, analyze, that Wrist singularity (at theta 5).

5) Discuss, prove, visualize, analyze Elbow singularity occurs when θ3 = −arctan(60/19) ≈ −72.43°.

6) Discuss, prove, visualize, analyze shoulder singularity occurs when the center of the robot wrist lies in the plane passing through the axes of joints 1 and 2.
