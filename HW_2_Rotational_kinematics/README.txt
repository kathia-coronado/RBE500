Rotational Kinematics

II-1

Find Problem 2-13 in the Spong et al. Problem 2-13 means problem #13 given at the end of Chapter 2 for the rest of the course. 

Present the matrix product that will give the resulting rotation matrix.
Produce a random number for all angle variables, and derive the matrix product with the random values.
[Hint for success]
Discuss among the class what I meant by "Present"
The Method section should present the sequence of rotations from 1-4.
In the Result section, give a brief note of how you would implement the sequence using Matlab, and put the code. 
II-2

Find Problem 2-37 in the Spong et al.

Present the homogeneous matrices for all three H's.
Present H02.
[Hint for success]
this hint is becoming redundant, but just coding H02 in Matlab is not what I am expecting. I am expecting IMRD style, particularly MR.
II-3

1. Study Denso's HSR robot. Here (Links to an external site.) is the link to the product page and video. 

2. Open the product specification in the LINK.     (Links to an external site.)Download a catalog (Links to an external site.).  Consider 480 mm reach model with 100 mm z-stroke. 

3. Discuss the homogeneous coordinate transformation from the base to the tip of the end third link (z-axis). Ignore the fourth rotational motion. Define the coordinate system of the base, and the links as you wish. Define any variables as you wish. (In a few weeks, I will define the rules of variables definitions. So enjoy your freedom to define your coordinate system as you wish. Try to use the same notations (H, sub and superscript, theta, phi, etc) we used in the lecture though)

4. Analyze the case where you rotate the first axis near the base 0 to 180 degrees clockwise (looking from above) from the initial Configuration Space with a 1-degree interval. At the same time, rotate the second axis from the base 0 to 90 degrees clockwise (looking from above) from the initial Configuration Space with 0.5-degree interval.  At the same time, give the z-axis a stroke ranging from 0 to 100 mm with 100/180 mm intervals.
