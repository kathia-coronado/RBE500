Your ultimate goal is to program Dr. Ron Alterovitz's program (Links to an external site.) in Matlab for two-link manipulator shown in Figure 3.6

1) The program should visualize a dot given a set of q's.  Sweep theta 1 and theta 2, and draw a dot as you sweep their values.

2) The obstacle in the work space should be a polygonal box defined freely by you. Rectangular box defined in the code is fine. If you are advanced user of Matlab, you could create a picture of the workspace outside of matlab, read it as binary (0 or 1) image. 

3) You can define the dimension of the manipulator as you wish.

4) The program should map the obstacle in the configuration space too. The obstacle in the configuration space doesn't have to be a solid shape with color filled. It can be a densely placed dots. Sweep theta1 and theta 2, check if the tip of the theta 1 is colliding with the obstacle in the workspace, and map a dot or something in the configuration space.

5) if you are an expert user, I would save the configuration space as a picture. It will be handy to have next week when you start using PRM or RRM solver for roadmap creation.
