Fundamentals of robotics engineering. Topics include forward and inverse kinematics, velocity kinematics, introduction to dynamics and control theory, sensors, actuators, basic probabilistic robotics concepts, fundamentals of computer vision, and robot ethics. In addition, modular robot programming will be covered, and the concepts learned will be applied using realistic simulators. (Prerequisites: Differential Equations (MA 2051 or equivalent), Linear Algebra (MA 2071 or equivalent) and the ability to program in a high-level language.)
