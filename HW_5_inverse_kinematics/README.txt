Problem 5-1.. Elbow Manipulator shown in Figure 5.4 (15 points). Construct the forward kinematics of the first three joints manipulator using the DH table shown in Tabl 5.1 and generate linearly spaced vectors for 100 points using linspace function (plot of the end effector) as you wish by sequentially or concurrently changing theta1 to theta 3. (Forward Kinematics)  Using the vector array in the linespace, and using Eq 5.40 - 5.42, plot the theta 1, 2, 3. Discuss the similarity of Figure theta's you produced, and the inverse kinematics produces.

 

[Disclosure... I created this problem for the first time in RBEs. I may change and revise the problem as the week goes. ]

Problem 5-2. SCARA Manipulator. (15 points)

Eq 5.48-5.54 and Figure 5.10 are poorly furnished with annotations, and the equations lack detail. Write your own Eq, and create a video to teach us. No need to create an IMRD paper. Simply post a video. 

[This assignment is also new. But I am more confident about this. I am more interested in how you all are equipped with video recording equipment to record lectures. ]
