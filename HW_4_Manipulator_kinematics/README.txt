Problem set III-1

Find Chapter 3.3.2 Three-Link Cylindrical Robot in Spong et al.

Analyze the motion by varing  theta 1 from 0 to 180 degrees,  d2 0 to 0.1 [m], d3 0 to 0.1 [m] (in sequence).


Problem set III-2

Consider the three-link articulated robot of Figure 3.16. Derive the forward kinematic equations using the DH convention. \


 

Analyze the locations of o_i (including o_0) as you change motion parameters ( theta_i, or d_i).

Problem set III-3

- Watch Denso's HSR robot again (Week 2). 
- Open the product specification LINK.     (Links to an external site.)Download a catalog (Links to an external site.). Consider 480 mm reach model with 100 mm z-stroke 
- Write DH parameters table using the same set of link parameters use decided to use in the Weak 2 assignment. 
- Analyze the motion - by rotating the first axis near the base 0 to 180 degrees clockwise (looking from above) from the initial Configuration Space with a 1-degree interval.  At the same time, rotate the second axis from the base 0 to 90 degrees clockwise (looking from above) from the initial Configuration Space with a 0.5-degree interval.  At the same time, give the z-axis a stroke ranging from 0 to 100 mm with 100/180 mm intervals. Plot the tip of the third z-axis in Matlab.
- Congrats...now you are using Forward Kinematics in the textbook in your real-life applications!
