The purpose of the assignment is to give feedback on your submissions and make sure there are no issues accessing the tools. This assignment will let you catch up with Matlab if you have not used it. This assignment also helps you to get used to the style of learning in RBE500. 

Write down the function g(t) that has the shape of a sine wave that increases linearly in frequency from 0Hz at t = 0s to 5Hz at t = 10s.
Plot the graph of this function using MATLAB's plot command.
Add to the same figure in a different color a graph of the same function sampled continuously at 5Hz.
